## Scripts

Start nodemon for the application `npm start`

Run the tests in watch mode `npm test`

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.
